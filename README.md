# trilobot-web-remote

A basic web page remote control for a Pimoroni Trilobot. It runs a Flask
server on the robot, and can be accessed on one's LAN. Controls for robot to
go forward, reverse, left, right, or stop. Exit button closes the web server.

To install clone or download this repository to the Trilobot Raspberry Pi,
and install required pacakges (trilobot, flask). And that should be about it.
